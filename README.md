# ColorBlindHelper
Color Blind Buddy is a live-video utility app for people who are color blind. Makes use of the [GPUImage2](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2) framework.

Created as a side project -- Winter Vacation 2016

**Features:**

• Highlight either the red or green regions of the image with an animated stripe pattern

• Saturation slider gives control over which regions will be striped, and also boosts the red/green hues of non-striped regions

• Freeze frame mode allows users to capture a scene to be referenced later

• Flashlight toggle enables color recognition in low light scenarios

• Simple interface for fast color recognition

# ColorBlindHelper
**NOTE: This is a personal project I created during free time in December 2016. This was my first time using Swift and GPUImage2, and as first experiences go, this project was a lot of fun! You can download Color Blind Buddy for free from the App Store at this [link.](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=1190798700&mt=8)**

Color Blind Buddy is a live-video utility app for people who are color blind. Makes use of the [GPUImage2](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2) framework.

**Features:**

• Highlight either the red or green regions of the image with an animated stripe pattern

• Saturation slider gives control over which regions will be striped, and also boosts the red/green hues of non-striped regions

• Freeze frame mode allows users to capture a scene to be referenced later

• Flashlight toggle enables color recognition in low light scenarios

• Simple interface for fast color recognition
